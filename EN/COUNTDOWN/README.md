# Programmable Arduino Countdown Timer

This project involves a programmable countdown timer based on the Arduino platform. 
It allows users to set a countdown duration in hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second and then start the countdown. 
The timer then displays the remaining time on an 8-digit LED display and emits a beep every second during the countdown.

## Features

- Easy programming of the countdown time.
- Display of remaining time on an 8-digit LED display.
- Audible beeps every second during the countdown.
- Ability to stop and restart the running countdown.

## Required Hardware

- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Nano)
- MAX7219-compatible 8-digit LED display
- 4x4 matrix keypad
- Speaker or buzzer
- Basic electronic components (resistors, wires, etc.)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have installed the Arduino development environment on your computer. You will also need the following libraries:

- Keypad Library: [https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad)
- LedControl Library: [https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the Arduino development environment installed on your computer.

2. Install the necessary libraries: `Keypad` and `LedControl`. You can find them in the provided source code links.

3. Connect your Arduino board to the components according to the wiring diagram provided in the documentation.

4. Load the code into the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino board.

## Usage

### Programming the Duration

- Press the "A" key to enter programming mode. You can start entering the countdown duration.

- Use the numerical keys (0-9) on the matrix keypad to enter the countdown duration in the format "HHMMSScc," where HH represents hours, MM represents minutes, SS represents seconds, and cc represents hundredths of a second.

### Starting the Countdown

- Press the "D" key to start the countdown. The display will show the remaining duration.

- The timer will emit a beep every second during the countdown.

### Stopping or Restarting the Countdown

- Press the "B" key to stop the ongoing countdown. The timer will stop, but the programmed duration will remain displayed.

- Press the "D" key to restart the ongoing countdown.

### Resetting and Reprogramming

- In programming mode, to clear the programmed duration and start over, press the "C" key, and you can begin the programming process again by pressing the "A" key.
